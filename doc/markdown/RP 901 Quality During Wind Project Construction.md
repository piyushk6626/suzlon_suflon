## Purpose and Scope

The scope of 'Quality During Wind Project Construction' addresses quality assurance and control during the construction phase of a wind site.

## Introduction

The Quality Committee is focused on reducing the levelized cost of energy (LCOE) for wind and creating visibility for and attracting attention to world-class quality standards and processes that reduce wind project costs.

In particular, the construction phase of a wind farm is a key area for cost reduction initiatives. Reviewing the project financials, turbine supply represents approximately 65-75% of total costs, while construction represents an additional 25-35%.

With firm turbine prices, the construction phase of a wind farm poses the most financial risks due to unforeseen variable costs. These costs can significantly impact the internal rate of return (IRR) if not addressed.

## Introduction

(continued)

'Quality During Wind Project Construction' includes four separate sample documents that together provide a template for quality assurance and control during the construction phase of a wind site. Certain details in the documents are specific to individual wind project sites but can be easily adapted to site-specific conditions.

-  The 'Quality Assurance/Quality Plan' provides a framework for attaining required quality levels during wind site construction. It provides management tools for executing quality assurance and quality control and includes documentation of quality protocols and responsibilities for a typical wind site construction project.
-  The 'Form of Job Books' provides a table of contents view of the typical inspections and tests that are performed and documented to assure quality of construction. Inspections may be deleted, added, or modified based on project specifics.
-  The 'Inspections and Test Plan' provides an example of a full inspection and test plan for 'Civil Construction Block' in the 'Form of Job Books'. A similarly detailed inspection and test plan exists for each section of the 'Form of Job Books'.
-  The 'Quality Control Procedure' provides an example of the documented procedure accompanying the 'Construction Period Road Inspection' subsection of the 'Civil Construction Block'. A similarly detailed procedure exists for each inspection in the full inspection and test plan.

## 17. Control of Quality Documentation

## 17.1. Purpose

The purpose of this section is to provide a method for identification, collection, accessing, filing, storage, maintenance, and disposition of quality records. These records are maintained to demonstrate conformance to contract document requirements and the effective operation of the wind energy quality control plan. Additionally, the purpose is to provide a method of preparing the turnover packages required by contract, a major portion of which will be quality records.

## 17.2. Scope

All Company quality records and turnover packages defined by contract are covered by this procedure. Pertinent subcontractor quality records and supplier/other data shall be components of these records and packages

## 17.3. Method (Procedure)

All site related quality inspections, test reports, qualifications, etc. will be submitted to the LFE for review. The LFE will review the documents for errors, content, and neatness. If the document is reviewed and proven to be incomplete or incorrect, the document will be re-issued to the submitting party for correction and re-submission. Once the LFE reviews the document as acceptable, the document will be scanned and filed by the site administrator. A hard copy and an electronic copy will be filed on site. The copies will be stored in books/files relating to the turbine associated with the document or to the area of work associated, i.e. civil, substation, collection, O&amp;M building, etc. The documents will also be tracked on a log which is utilized to track what documents have been submitted and what documents are outstanding.

## Quality Control Procedure

The Quality Control Procedure provides an example of the documented procedure accompanying the "Construction Period Road Inspection" subsection of the "Civil Construction Block". A similarly detailed procedure exists for each inspection in the full inspection and test plan.

1. Damalina Ton Coil

## 1.0. Purpose

To ensure that the road installation is completed   per design drawings and specifications.

## 2.0. Revision History

## C-1 Road Inspection

- 4.4. The next item will ask you if the topsoil has been removed. It may seem obvious if you're working with grass land; however, if you are working in a plowed field it may be hard to notice if they really removed the top soil or not. If the top soil has been removed and is accepted, you can circle "Yes" and move to the next line. You will need to review the specifications for the required depth of the subgrade.

## 3.0. Required Tools &amp; Equipment

-  Personal Protective Equipment (PPE)
-  25' and 100' tape measure
-  Laser level
-  Digital level
-  Pick axe
-  Two steel pins
-  String line
-  Hammer
-  Measuring wheel
-  Wood lathes
-  Paint pen
-  Digital camera
-  Civil drawings and specifications

## 4.0. Procedure

- 4.1. Start by going through the inspection form line by line to know what you will need to look for once in the field. Also, fill in your job name, number, and the design specifications prior to printing the inspection form so you don't have to fill it out each time. Any changes to the C-1 Inspection form shall be approved.
- 4.2. Before going out on site to inspect roads, bring your road drawings and specifications. Also bring the required tools and equipment.
- 4.3. The first line on the inspection form will ask you for the road name or identifier. Each road section should have some sort of identification to determine the location of the inspection.
- 4.5. The next line item will ask if the SWPPP Plan has been implemented and completed per specifications. Circle "Yes" if it is in place and move on with your inspection.
- 4.6. Before placing any base material, there are a few things that need to happen before cutting the contractor loose. First, the material that is planned on being used must be submitted to the civil engineers for their approval (ensure it has been accepted). Second, the subgrade must be complete and passing. This may require a proof roll of the sub-grade or even a density test, each requiring a third party inspector to complete the test. Once either has been completed and is accepted, you can circle "Yes". It is a good practice to note when the sub-grade actually passed on your sheet as well.

- 4.7. Next on your inspection form you will find it asks you if geotextile fabric has been installed. Typically geotextile fabric is required; however, some soil types do not require it. You will need to check your specifications to determine whether this is needed or not. If it is required, ensure it has been installed properly and circle "Yes". PERMANENT CRAVEL FREA
- 4.8. The next line item will ask if the compaction reports have passed specification requirements. For the road base material to pass inspection, you will need to get the compaction reports from your third party tester on-site, and the results must meet or exceed the specifications. A good practice is to track where the road base has passed compaction requirements on a map so you're not missing any reports when it comes to submitting them to the owners.
- 4.9. The next line item will ask if the road radius for access points and curves has been installed per specifications. Usually the road radius is determined by the turbine manufacturer and transportation company. If inspection passes, circle "Yes" and move onto the next question.
- 4.10. The next step is to check your road width. Do so by placing two metal pins on each side of the road and measuring the distance between the two points. If there is a PE available to assist with the inspection, they can hold the other end of the tape instead of using the pins. This should be completed before the road shoulders have been pulled up. Once the shoulders have been pulled up, it will be hard to determine where the exact edge of the road is.

## C-1 Road Inspection (continued)

- 4.11. Over the duration of the project, the thickness of the road will change from traffic and maintenance. So your QA/QC for the thickness of the roads should be complete when the final grading of the road has been done. However, you should spot check the depth of the roads during construction, as well, to avoid any major repair areas toward the end of the project. Try catching the problem areas while the crew is there placing the material, they are a lot more willing to do the work while they are in the area.
- 4.12. To complete the depth check, you will need your pick axe, tape measure, and wood lathe. Pick a hole in a random spot of the road (don't always do the center or edge of the road) until you reach the sub-grade. Once you have reached the sub-grade, measure from the top of the sub-grade to the top of the base material. This will give you the depth of the road. If this is within the tolerance of your design, it is acceptable. If not, you will need to get the contractor back and spot dump some material in the troublesome areas.
- 4.13. To measure crown height, take two bricks and a string line tied between the two. The distance between the bricks should be the width of the road. Use a tape measure to measure the distance from the string at the center and both edges. The distance at the edge minus the distance at the center should equal your crown height.
- 4.14. In some cases, the engineer may not require a crown to the road design. Instead they may design the road with a slope to maintain an existing drainage pattern (usually 1% to 2% max slope). You will need to adjust your inspection form accordingly.
- 4.15. Next you will need to check the actual grade of the road sections. The maximum grade should be per the engineer design and specifications. It is a good idea to double check with the crane manuals, as well, to make sure all ends are covered. If at all possible, check this before any base material is placed. If it is not within specifications, the
- contractor will be able to work with the sub-grade a lot easier and cheaper than the base material. To complete the test, place your digital level on the road. The longer your level is, the more accurate your results will be. So if you have a small level, it is a good idea to place a piece of angle iron, or something that will stay true over the duration of the project, under your level. If your results come under your maximum allowable grade percentage, then the road is acceptable.
- 4.16. To check for dips and bumps, you can complete this task two ways. 1) Use a 100' tape measure and survey equipment or 2) take two bricks and a string line tied between the two. The distance between the bricks should be about 50'. Use a tape measure to measure the distance from the string to the road in high and low spots. If this distance is greater than the required dip or swale, it fails. Remember to subtract or add the height of the brick. It is important that you complete this inspection prior to any turbine component deliveries. If either of these are out of tolerance, the delivery trucks may get hung up and cause damage to their trucks.
- 4.17. In the comment section, record any notes that you feel add value to this inspection.

## 5.0 Approval

- 5.1. Non-conformance notices (NCN) are written when there is   an issue with some aspect of the road that cannot be fixed in a quick manner, e.g. that same day. If all NCNs have been closed, circle "Yes". If there is an open NCN issue, you will need to verify that it is closed.
- 5.2. A photographic record is not required for each road section inspection. However, photos should be taken of the installation process and final product for documentation purposes.
- 5.3. Depending on the dynamics of your project, there may be a few road modifications during construction. This may be due to landowner issues, wet land issues, or other. Ensure all road changes have been approved by the civil superintendent and all applicable parties (owner, landowner and civil engineer). The civil drawings shall be updated and redlined with all road changes.
- 5.4. If all the items on this inspection form have been recorded and accepted, and all items are within the specified tolerances of the design drawings, the road is acceptable. Have the installation foreman, as well as yourself, sign the bottom of the form. The road inspection form will then be filed in its appropriate quality control book.

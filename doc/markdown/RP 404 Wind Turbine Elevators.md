## RP 404 Wind Turbine Elevators

The following recommended practice (RP) is subject to the disclaimer at the front of this manual. It is important that users read the disclaimer before considering adoption of any portion of this recommended practice.

This recommended practice was prepared by a committee of the AWEA Operations and Maintenance (O&amp;M) Committee.

Committee Chair: Oliver Hirschfelder, Capital Safety Principal Author: Carisa Barrett, Elevator Industry Work Preservation Fund

## Purpose and Scope

The scope of 'Wind Turbine Elevators' addresses the common maintenance issues related to the wind turbine elevator. It is not machine specific and some adaptation may be required based on specific designs.

## Introduction

Before installing, maintaining, and/or repairing any wind turbine elevators, check with the 'Authority Having Jurisdiction' you are working in for permitting and inspection requirements. If they are regulated, all work must be performed in accordance with the adopted codes, rules, and regulations. Currently a majority of jurisdictions require conformance to ASME A17.1/CSA B44, Section 5.11. Companies should be cognizant that some jurisdictions do not have requirements and the elevators purchased may not conform to the new code requirements. Care should be taken to consider risks associated with this lack of conformance.

## Excerpts from the ASME A17.1/CSA B44, Section 5.11

## 1. Elevator, Wind Turbine Tower

- 1.1. A hoisting and lowering mechanism equipped with a car installed in a wind turbine tower.
2. Part 5 Applies to Special Application Elevators as Specified in the Following Requirements:
- (k) Section 5.11 applies to elevators used in wind turbine towers

## 3. Scope

Requirement 5.11 applies to elevators permanently installed inside an enclosed wind turbine tower to provide vertical transportation of authorized personnel and their tools and equipment for the purpose of servicing, maintaining, and inspecting wind turbine equipment.

Such elevators are typically subjected to extreme temperatures, humidity variations, and substantial horizontal motion where, by reason of their limited use and the types of construction of the structures served, full compliance with Part 2 is not practicable or necessary.

## Purpose and Scope

The scope of 'Fall Protection, Rescue Systems, Climb Assist, and Harness' addresses the common maintenance issues related to the grounding systems for generator and drive train shafts in various wind turbine designs. It is not machine specific and some adaptation may be required based on specific designs.

## Fall Protection, Rescue Systems, Climb Assist, and Harness

## 1. Flexible Cable Ladder Safety System

- 1.1. Flexible cable ladder systems are designed to provide protection against falling for persons climbing vertical surfaces. These systems include installations on fixed ladders within the tower. The following inspection criteria is for user inspection and information purposes only. Formal inspections of ladder climbing systems must be conducted by personnel certified in their installation and inspection as required by the manufacturer.

## 2. Cable System Inspection

- 2.1. Inspect the top and bottom anchorage brackets for damage, corrosion, or rust. Look for cracks, bends, or wear that could affect the strength and operation of the system. Inspect for loose or missing fasteners; re-tighten or replace them if necessary.
- 2.2. Inspect the cable guides. Ensure the cable guide is not worn or bent, and still locks on the cable. Inspect for loose or missing fasteners; retighten or replace them if necessary.

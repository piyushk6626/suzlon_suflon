## RP 701 Wind Project End of Warranty Management and Inspections

The following recommended practice (RP) is subject to the disclaimer at the front of this manual. It is important that users read the disclaimer before considering adoption of any portion of this recommended practice.

This recommended practice was prepared by a committee of the AWEA Operations and Maintenance (O&amp;M) Committee .

Committee Chair: Holly Hughes, Natural Power Principal Author(s): Eddy Grunenwald, Wanzek Krys Rootham, Acciona; Kevin Alewine, Shermco; Chris Henderson, Hendo Consulting Reviewing Committee: Rich Jigarjian, EDF-R; Bruce Hammett, WECS

## Purpose and Scope

The scope of 'Wind Project End of Warranty Management and Inspections' discusses preferred methods used to effectively manage construction workmanship, balance of plant (BOP) equipment, wind turbine, and serial defect warranties. This process includes assessing the condition of BOP equipment and wind turbines prior to the expiration of the original equipment manufacturer (OEM) warranty, commonly referred to as end of warranty (EOW) inspections. This document also includes information useful for following the best practice of performing operational audits and quality control of the service provider postwarranty. It is also recommended that the reader consults applicable IEEE, ASTM, IEC, and other industry guidance and standards.

The transition out of the warranty period is a critical milestone in the life of a wind project. Defects or damage due to design, manufacturing, shipping, installation, and maintenance practices are typically covered under warranty agreements and can often be repaired or replaced during this time so that equipment is in the best possible condition exiting the warranty. It is also important to identify and address any sub-performing aspects of the equipment during this period, which can be of particular significance for new models. Scheduled maintenance inspections may not detect component failures and a more thorough inspection with specialized tools is recommended prior to warranty expiration. The priorities in an EOW inspection are to identify component failures, particularly on the critical and highest costs components, and any items which may pose hazards to equipment or the health and safety of site personnel and to document the condition of the turbines and related equipment for future reference. Claims may result in component replacement or commercial changes to ensure the owner is protected, e.g. an extended warranty on a particular component. Some amount of normal wear and tear should be expected and will not necessarily impact the ability of a component to meet its design life or result in a successful warranty claim.

1

## Purpose and Scope

(continued)

The purpose of this document is to describe recommendations for warranty management and the most appropriate techniques used in EOW inspections. These practices, if properly applied, should lead to the submission of welldocumented warranty claims and facilitate effective warranty management.

## Introduction

There are many factors and timeframes to consider when planning for effective management of various warranties. There are contractual elements that influence the process, e.g. a serial defect clause may have a different timeframe for exercising rights than the overall warranty timeframe. Main warranty elements of a typical wind project may include the following:

-  EPC contractor workmanship
-  BOP equipment
-  Turbine equipment
-  Turbine performance, e.g. sound and power

Management of some of the sub-elements of the main items listed above is more reactionary, whereas others require more pro-active planning, testing, and inspection in order to exercise and maximize warranty rights. However, in all cases, awareness of the various warranty elements and timelines is essential.

The scope of an EOW inspection campaign can range from minimal to complex depending on the time and cost constraints and the interest of the project owner. In addition, utilizing a reputable independent third-party for inspections may add more credibility to the findings. A wide variety of inspection techniques are available and the project owner must decide which are appropriate for their situation. Known issues may exist with a particular component, warranting specific inspection techniques that may not be necessary in all cases. Many equipment warranty items are OEM dependent and industry user groups can provide a useful forum for leveraging pooled information. This can help in warranty claims and in tailoring the end of warranty approach to pre-manage specific known issues. For large projects, it can be beneficial to conduct a diverse range of inspection tasks on a sample population of turbines prior to the full-scale inspection campaign. This can establish the most critical tasks and determine the scope of inspections to be conducted for the entire project.

## Introduction

(continued)

Individual inspection tasks during the complete EOW inspection campaign can be completed on 100% of turbines on a project or on a smaller sample population, depending on the criticality, cost, and time required for the particular task. While project-specific circumstances will vary, the best practice is to inspect 100% of major components or any component where there is potential for a serial defect claim. It is advisable that owners take their serial defect threshold definitions into account when deciding how many turbine components to inspect. Some inspection tasks may only be triggered if a problem is identified by other means. For other components, or for QA/QC inspections, the owner should evaluate their risk tolerance, the risk, and their serial defect threshold definitions to decide whether to use 100% inspection or a sampling approach. Evaluation of supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) data and review of parts usage at the project is recommended for identifying components or turbines that warrant additional targeted attention during EOW inspections.

Inspections may be conducted by independent third-party organizations, the project owner, or combinations of several groups with specialized skill sets. Representatives from the OEM and/or owner may accompany inspection teams or teams can operate independently. Best practice is to involve site staff, owner's engineers, and the OEM during the initial inspections so the processes can be reviewed and agreed upon by all parties at the onset of inspections.

Inspections are a human process with some subjectivity in discerning between normal wear and tear and actual claims. Note that inspectors generally do not inspect certain items to avoid disturbing their condition. Power performance testing or sound testing may also be considered.

## Timing and Planning

Points to consider:

-  Contractual elements, such as turbine-by-turbine warranty timing, may not coincide with project wide timing of warranties. Note that serial defect warranty timing may not align with other project warranty timing.
-  Consider conducting end of warranty inspections following a maintenance cycle so the inspections can focus more on warranty items rather than items that will be picked up during maintenance.
-  Consider timing inspections to maximize the warranty period while allowing sufficient time to make claims.
-  Pick timing that will minimize lost energy production due to inspection activity.

3

## Timing and Planning

(continued)

Points to consider:

-  Timing of tests may require steps to be initiated prior to completion of construction, e.g. power performance test site calibration, if required.
-  Consider effects of daily scheduling, e.g. early morning shifts help avoid the hottest times of day.
-  Consider major component spares that may have time-based maintenance and associated warranties.

## Balance of Plant (BOP) End of Warranty Inspections

The expiration of warranties for balance of plant equipment and installation may or may not coincide with the wind turbines' OEM warranties. Planning the EOW inspections for the balance of plant should be a consideration. The balance of plant EOW will include the collection system, substation, civil site improvements, O&amp;M building, and met mast.

## 1. Procedure

1.1. Obtain a complete drawing package for collection system to  ensure correctness and completeness.

1.2. Determine the expiration dates and allow for sufficient time to conduct the inspections, analyze the results, and file any          necessary claims.

1.3. EOW inspections should include a review of the contractor  turnover package and site maintenance documentation to          understand the as -built condition and what has occurred while the equipment and site were under warranty.

1.4. Based on a review of the documentation as mentioned above, determine the scope and scale of the BOP inspection. Inspections may be for the total site or a representative sample of each area.

1.5. Agree on the personnel that will be involved: OEM technicians, thirdparty inspection, site operator, and owner's representative.

## 1.2. Drivetrain

## 1.2.1. Gearbox

Borescopes are commonly used to document the condition of gear teeth and bearings within the gearbox. Borescope inspection is recommended for gearboxes. Borescope images should be taken in all accessible areas of the gearbox, regardless of whether or not damage exists, to document the condition. Images should include the gearbox nameplate, and reference photo cards should be used to identify each section of the gearbox. Images of each component should be taken in a consistent order for all gearboxes. Areas of the gearbox that cannot be accessed should be noted, and images of obstructions taken where appropriate, such as a bearing cage blocking inspection of bearing races.

Image quality should be the most important factor in borescope selection, as some borescopes are inadequate for wind turbine gearbox inspections. The rigidity of guide tubes, lens cleanliness, the type and quality of light, and, particularly, technician training, all affect image quality.

The time required for a borescope inspection is highly variable depending on access, operator skill level, and the number of positions in which the gearbox will be stopped to permit inspections.

17

## 1.2.1 Gearbox

(continued)

Additional elements of a gearbox inspection should include visual inspection of the housing for cracks and leaks, damaged ancillary equipment, oil level in the sight glass, and magnets. Any abnormal color, smell, or foam in the oil should also be noted at the time of inspection.

## 1.2.2. Main Shaft

Visually and functionally inspect the brake assembly for proper operation. This can include making sure that rotor locking pins can be inserted correctly and that the brake operates as expected.

Visually inspect the high-speed flexible coupling between the gearbox and generator. Verify that bolts have torque marks and that the coupling has been aligned and installed correctly according to the coupling OEM's installation manual.

## 1.2.3. Main Bearing

Visually inspect the main bearing and record any signs of leakage from the seals. Inspect the grease trap and note signs of excessive grease or grease that is discolored or appears shiny. Grease samples can be taken from the main bearing and sent to a lab for analysis.

Temperature trending of the main bearings can also be used to target certain bearings for inspection. Signs of gradual temperature rise over time or temperatures that appear higher than the rest of the site are good candidates for further inspection.

Vibration analysis can also be done on the main bearing. It is important to note that, since the main bearing is a low-speed component, this analysis is limited in its effectiveness in finding issues and will need to be done in concert with the other inspection techniques described in this section.

A borescope may also be used in some cases to look at the internal sections of the main bearing. This can provide detailed pictures similar to gearbox borescopes showing internal damage.

## 1.3. Bland Inspections: Done

Visual inspection of the blade surface is commonly conducted from the ground and at the blade surface using various access techniques. One hundred percent of turbine blades should be inspected. Each blade should be photographed with images covering the entire surface and from different angles so the leading edge, trailing edge, and high and lowpressure surfaces are all clearly visible. Using a camera is preferable to a spotting scope or binoculars, as a camera provides documentation that can be reviewed by others and, in some cases, damage may not be evident until post processing of the images is done. Drone camera inspections are also an option and may be more cost effective depending on the site conditions present. Several (5-10) complete rotors can be completely documented by an experienced crew in a day. Inspection of all blades is recommended.

Figure B: Example of Blade Damage Documented with Ground-based Digital Photography.

19

## 1.3. Bland Inspections - Done

(continued)

Direct access inspections, e.g. ropes, platforms, boom trucks, etc., can be used to detect damage that may not be visible in ground-based images, e.g. small cracks. In some cases, the extent of damage may not be clear in ground-based images and can be clarified through direct access inspections. Ultrasonic testing (UT) or other non-destructive techniques that can detect the presence of other defects and voids in adhesive bonds can also be performed during direct access inspections. A single crew can typically inspect 1-2 rotors per day but these inspections impose greater limitations on safe working conditions, e.g. wind speed limits, so a sample of 10-20% of the project is often more feasible.

It is recommended that the inspections ensure that the lightning protection system (LPS) is functioning as intended.

Consider whether internal blade inspections are required noting this may be considered a permit required confined space.

## 1.4. Turbine Electrical

Verify all power connections are tight to manufacturer's requirements. Verify general cleanliness of enclosure(s) interior. Inspect all wiring, power, and control for evidence of high heat and poor connections at each end. Verify communications wiring is in good condition and properly physically placed and connected. Verify sub-distribution equipment including contactors, circuit breakers, fuse/holder, terminal blocks, surge arrestors, transformers, fans, capacitors, and all other operation-critical components are in good working condition.

## 1.4.1. Power Converter

Visually inspect the power converter of the turbine and ensure that all wiring is organized, routed, and terminated correctly. Inspect wires for signs of damaged insulation and note any wires that are not labeled at the spot of termination. This may indicate the presence of a jumper wire that may be bypassing certain controls.

20

## 1.4.1. Power Converter

(continued)

Verify all power connections are tight to manufacturer's requirements. Verify general cleanliness of enclosure(s) interior. Inspect all wiring, power, and control, for evidence of high heat and poor connections at each end. Verify communications wiring is in good condition and properly physically placed and connected. Verify sub-distribution equipment including contactors, circuit breakers, fuse/holder, terminal blocks, surge arrestors, transformers, fans, reactors, capacitors, and all other operation-critical components are in good working condition. Check for cleanliness internally and externally.

From records or onboard database, review the number of operations and various trip reasons looking for high energy trips to resolution. Verify factory required maintenance performance schedule. Verify wiring of accessories are tight and clear of heat or fault damage. Test according to manufacturer's instructions.

Visually inspect the heat exchanger system and note any signs of damage to the cooling fins or fans used to remove heat from the power converter. Verify cooling system is fully operational to factory and manufacturers standards. Note replacement history records indicating repetitive failure modes and results.

For liquid-cooled power converters inspect for signs of leakage and ensure that the system has been filled to the correct level and purged of air for proper operation.

## 1.4.2. Medium Voltage (MV) Switchgear, Where Used

Complete battery of operational testing per manufacturer's requirements including remote trip mechanism and system. Visually inspect accessory wiring, MV connections, and communications, where used.

## 1.4.3 MV Uptower Transformers, Where Used

Monitor gauges when available. Inspect accessory wiring and accessory monitoring equipment where used. Perform insulation test.

21

## 1.4.4. Low Voltage (LV) Control

Work from as-built drawings and factory specifications to inspect:

-  Main Power Panel: Visually inspect exterior of main control panel breakers for wear and tear, corrosion, and functionality of moving mechanical parts.
-  Main Circuit Breaker: Check for cleanliness externally and externally. Verify from records or onboard database number of operations and various trip reasons looking for high energy trips to resolution. Verify factory required maintenance performance schedule. Verify wiring of accessories are tight and clear of heat or fault damage. Verify proper lubrication. For draw-out breakers perform complete in/out operation visually inspecting tracks, motion, lubrication and the electrical contacts and connections are in good working order within wear standards. Test according to manufacturer's instructions.
-  Main Contactor: Check for cleanliness externally and externally. Verify from records or onboard database number of operations. Verify factory required maintenance performance schedule. Verify wiring of accessories are tight and clear of heat or fault damage. Verify proper lubrication. Perform complete operation visually inspecting tracks, motion, lubrication, and the electrical contacts are in good working order within wear standards. Test according to manufacturer's instructions.

## 1.5. Walk-Down Inspection

A walk-down inspection of the complete turbine is recommended to document safety issues, the general turbine condition, and component failures. Walk-down inspection is recommended for 100% of turbines. A common checklist and rating system for findings to be used for all turbines on a project should be developed with input from the inspection team, owner, site managers, maintenance staff, and the OEM. Checklists provided by the OEM for regular maintenance are a useful starting point for development of the walk-down inspection checklist. Digital images of any observed damage should be collected in addition to the checklists.

22

<!-- image -->

## 1.5. Walk-Down Inspection

(continued)

Inspection crews should have access to turbine controls to be able to test certain systems for function, such as yaw motors, fans, pumps, and brakes. A walk-down typically includes inspection of cables and general housekeeping and checking valves for leaks and function. Some areas of the turbine require specialized training or equipment to access, such as transformers located in nacelles.

During the walk-down inspection, it is recommended to conduct calibration checks of turbine alignment into the wind and calibration of pitch angles. Nacelle and tower inspection checklists are recommended to include inspection structural elements including inspecting the bed plate, tower welds, nacelle structure, nose cone, and fiberglass for cracks.

During the walk-down, check for corrosion on tower sections, cracks in grout (if in use), bolt covers for integrity, and any peeling coatings or corrosion particularly at the touch-up areas. If required, conduct pull tests to ensure bolts meet proper pre-load.

During the walk down inspection, inspect the full array of tower components including heating systems, insulation, anchor points, filters, louvers, decks, hatches and doors, and gantry cranes.

Check for appropriate storage of nacelle access ladder, if applicable.

For the turbine hydraulic, inspect hydraulic water and oil systems of the pitch, yaw, oil cooling, generator cooling, electrical connections, and monitoring for operation, leakage, and general uncleanliness, which may indicate unresolved problems.

All bushings require visual inspections, grease inspections, leak inspections, and a check of the torque marks.

## 1.6. Retrofits/Upgrades/Software/Firmware

As part of the end of warranty process, it should be confirmed that all applicable manufacturer retrofits and upgrades have been implemented at the site. Best practice includes auditing the software, firmware, and programmable logic control (PLC) programming revisions on each turbine to confirm they are consistent and up-to-date. This recommendation also applies to converter software.

## 1.7. Pitch System

The type of pitch system (hydraulic or electric) will dictate the specifics of the appropriate inspection methods. Samples of hydraulic fluid may be taken for analysis. Battery systems may require inspections.

-  Pitch bearing grease samples may need to be taken.
-  Inspect pitch system control cabinets and hardware. Verify mounting system integrity.
-  Inspect teeth for wear and cracks.
-  Inspect pitch encoder position.
-  Inspect pitch accumulators and cylinders for integrity, leaks, appropriate fill levels, dust covers, and oil leaks.
-  Inspect pitch motors, gearbox, batteries, and chargers.

## 1.8. Yaw System

-  Where applicable, check puck measurements for uneven wear and cracks.
-  Visually check yaw encoder.
-  Inspect for excessive wear or cracks in gear teeth.
-  Inspect motors, gearboxes, drives, and braking system.
-  Inspect the lubrication system.
-  Inspect yaw bearing grease samples as applicable.

## 1.9. Lubricant Sampling and Testing: Done

Sampling and testing of gearbox oil and main bearing grease should be conducted as part of the EOW inspection if this is not already being done as part of regular maintenance or if laboratory reports are not made available to the project owner. Laboratory testing can identify wear metals in the lubricant, the condition of the lubricant itself, and may indicate possible damage to the equipment. The presence of water, changes in viscosity, and additive breakdown can result in a failure of the lubricant, which is, in itself, a critical system. Hydraulic oil, blade bearing grease, and other lubricants may also be sampled and tested as needed. Detailed procedures for lubricant sampling and testing are described in RP 812 and RP 813.

## 1.10. Generator Testing and Inspection

Electrical testing of the generator can be done with specialized tools and may detect problems with winding insulation, although the ability of these tests to predict failure is limited. A description of specific tests can be found in RP 203. The condition of generator cable terminations may also be inspected and signs of previous arcing identified during testing.

In some cases, it may be possible to inspect generator internals with a borescope, where evidence of arcing, dust generated from loose wedges, and excess grease or debris may be observed and documented. Consider inspections for fatigue cracks of components, the insulation, and windings with a borescope. A generator alignment check may be conducted. Reference 'Collector Assembly (Slip Rings and Brushes)' in RP 201. Also reference 'Generator Alignment' in RP 205.

## 1.11. Vibration Measurement: Done

Vibration data, also called condition monitoring system data, can be valuable in detecting faults in parts of the drive train that may not be otherwise accessible. Data from a permanently installed system are preferable as they allow for long-term trending; however, portable vibration systems which can be installed temporarily for EOW inspections may still detect many faults. Vibration data alone will typically not be sufficient to make a warranty claim, but identification of faults through vibration may trigger additional focused borescoping or other inspection techniques which may be impractical to conduct site-wide, such as a partial bearing disassembly and cleaning. Additional information on vibration measurement can be found in RP 204 and RP 811.

## 2. EOW Inspection Schedule

Inspections should be planned such that delivery of final inspection reports can be made well before the warranty expiration; however, warranty claims can be made at any time before the expiration if sufficient evidence is available. Consult the project contacts to be aware of notification and any timing requirements. Warranty claims will need to be reviewed by the OEM, and not all claims will be accepted, so including ample time for discussion after claims are made but before the warranty has expired is critical. Planning for delivery of inspection results prior to the warranty expiration is considered best practice. Note that notification for serial defect claims should be made as soon as the thresholds are reached; this should not wait until the end of the contract period.

Multiple teams with specialized inspection skills may be deployed across the site and the sequence of deployment is critical to ensure the initial teams provide information to subsequent teams. For example, ground-based blade inspections will inform the choice of turbines that receive direct-access blade inspections. Inspection teams should be given complete access to the turbines and trained to safely stop and control equipment as required for inspections.

## 3. EOW Reporting

Large amounts of data are generated during an inspection campaign and it is critical to distill the raw data into reports that can be used by project owners to make claims and provide sufficient information for the OEM review. A projectwide executive summary should be produced that identifies the most critical observations and patterns of abnormal wear or damage. The summary report should describe the inspection methods and tools used, nomenclature employed, criteria for classifying observations, photographs, and inspection coverage for all tasks.

Detailed individual turbine reports for each inspection task should also be generated which clearly document the observed conditions. These detailed reports should document the make, model, and serial number(s) of major components, date of inspection, tools used, and the names of the inspectors. For example, each turbine should have a unique borescope inspection report that includes representative images from each section of the gearbox and clearly identifies any damage.

## 3. EOW Reporting

(continued)

All raw data should be retained and provided to the project owner. These data may be required during the claim process and can be used to benchmark the turbine condition for future reference.

Users need to decide on the amount of data they want to collect.

## Summary

Proper EOW management and inspections are effective for documenting the equipment condition in detail prior to warranty expiration and should be performed on all wind projects. A large number of inspection techniques can be deployed as part of an EOW inspection campaign and project owners must consider which are appropriate for their project.

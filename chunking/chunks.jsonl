A similarly \ndetailed procedure exists for each inspection in the full inspection and test plan.  \n \nC-1 Road Inspection  \n1.0. Purpose  \n \nTo ensure that the road installation is completed  per design \ndrawings and specifications.  \n \n2.0. Revision History  \n \n \n \n \n3.0. Required Tools & Equipment  \n \n\uf0b7 Personal Protective Equipment (PPE)  \n\uf0b7 25' and 100' tape measure  \n\uf0b7 Laser level  \n\uf0b7 Digital level  \n\uf0b7 Pick axe  \n\uf0b7 Two steel pins  \n\uf0b7 String line  \n\uf0b7 Hammer  \n\uf0b7 Measuring wheel  \n\uf0b7 Wood lathes  \n\uf0b7 Paint pen  \n\uf0b7 Digital camera  \n\uf0b7 Civil drawings and specifications  \n \n4.0. Procedure  \n     4.1.  Start by going through the inspection form line by    \n line to know what you will need to look for once in \n the field. Also, fill in your job name, number, and \n the design specifications prior to printing the  \n inspection form so you don't have to fill it out \n each time. Any changes to the C -1 Inspection form \n shall be approved.  \n \n     4.2.  Before going out on site to inspect roads, bring your \n road drawings and specifications. Also bring the   \n required tools and equipment.  \n \n     4.3.  The first line on the inspection form will ask you for \n the road name or identifier. Each road section \n should have some sort of identification to determine \n the location of the inspection.        4.4. The next item will ask you if the topsoil has been \n removed. It may seem obvious if you \u2019re working \n with grass land; however, if you are working in a \n plowed field it may be hard to notice if they really \n removed the top soil or not. If the top soil has been \n removed and is accepted, you can circle \"Yes\" and \n move to the next line. You will need to review the \n specifications for the required depth of the sub -\n grade.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      4.5. The next line item will ask if the SWPPP Plan has \n been implemented and completed per  \n specifications. Circle \"Yes\" if it is in place and \n move on with your inspection.  \n \n      4.6. Before placing any base material, there are a few \n things that need to happen before cutting the con -\n tractor loose. First, the material that is planned on \n being used must be submitted to the civil \n engineers for their approval (ensure it has been \n accepted). Second, the subgrade must be \n complete and passing. This may require a proof \n roll of the sub -grade or even a density test, each \n requiring a third party inspector to complete the \n test. Once either has been completed and is \n accepted, you can circle \"Yes\". It is a good \n practice to note when the sub -grade actually \n passed on your sheet as well.  \nFigure 4.1: Removing Top Soil", "start_page": 421, "end_page": 423}

Next on your inspection form you will find it asks  \n you if geotextile fabric has been installed. Typically  \n geotextile fabric is required; however, some soil  \n types do not require it. You will need to check your  \n specifications to determine whether this is needed  \n or not. If it is required, ensure it has been installed  \n properly and circle \"Yes\".  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      4.8. The next line item will ask if the compaction reports \n have passed specification requirements. For the  \n road base material to pass inspection, you will need  \n to get the compaction reports from your third party  \n tester on -site, and the results must meet or exceed  \n the specifications. A good practice is to track where  \n the road base has passed compaction   \n requirements on a map so you \u2019re not missing any \n reports when it comes to submitting them to the \n owners.   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      4.9. The next line item will ask if the road radius for \n access points and curves has been installed per \n specifications. Usually the road radius is \n determined by the turbine manufacturer and \n transportation company. If inspection passes,  \n circle \"Yes\" and move onto the next question.  \n \n      4.10. The next step is to check your road width. Do so \n by placing two metal pins on each side of the road \n and measuring the distance between the two \n points. If there is a PE available to assist with the \n inspection, they can hold the other end of the tape \n instead of using the pins. This should be \n completed before the road shoulders have been \n pulled up. Once the shoulders have been pulled \n up, it will be hard to determine where the exact \n edge of the road is.  Figure 4.5: Performing QC Check on Grav-\nel Installation  \nFigure 4.2: Installing Geotextile Fabric  \nFigure 4.3: Typical Access Road Entrance Detail  \nFigure 4.4: Compacting Road Base  \n\n\nOperations and Maintenance  \nRecommended Practices  \n\u00a9American Wind Energy Association 2017                                                                                  \n77                                      C-1 Road Inspection (continued)  \n      4.11. Over the duration of the project, the thickness of \n the road will change from traffic and maintenance. \n So your QA/QC for the thickness of the roads \n should be complete when the final grading of the \n road has been done. However, you should spot \n check the depth of the roads during construction, as \n well, to avoid any major repair areas toward the end \n of the project. Try catching the problem areas while \n the crew is there placing the material, they are a lot \n more willing to do the work while they are in the  \n area.  \n \n      4.12. To complete the depth check, you will need your \n pick axe, tape measure, and wood lathe. Pick a \n hole in a random spot of the road (don't always do \n the center or edge of the road) until you reach the \n sub-grade. Once you have reached the sub -grade, \n measure from the top of the sub -grade to the top of \n the base material. This will give you the depth of \n the road. If this is within the tolerance of your \n design, it is acceptable. If not, you will need to get \n the contractor back and spot dump some material \n in the troublesome areas.  \n \n      4.13. To measure crown height, take two bricks and a \n string line tied between the two. The distance \n between the bricks should be the width of the road. \n Use a tape measure to measure the distance from \n the string at the center and both edges. The \n distance at the edge minus the distance at the \n center should equal your crown height.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      4.14. In some cases, the engineer may not require a \n crown to the road design. Instead they may design \n the road with a slope to maintain an existing  \n drainage pattern (usually 1% to 2% max slope). \n You will need to adjust your inspection form  \n accordingly.  \n \n     4.15. Next you will need to check the actual grade of the \n road sections. The maximum grade should be per \n the engineer design and specifications. It is a good \n idea to double check with the crane manuals, as \n well, to make sure all ends are covered. If at all \n possible, check this before any base material is \n placed. If it is not within specifications, the   contractor will be able to work with the sub -grade \n a lot easier and cheaper than the base material. \n To complete the test, place your digital level on \n the road. The longer your level is, the more accu -\n rate your results will be. So if you have a small \n level, it is a good idea to place a piece of angle \n iron, or something that will stay true over the dura -\n tion of the project, under your level. If your results \n come under your maximum allowable grade per -\n centage, then the road is acceptable.  \n \n      4.16. To check for dips and bumps, you can complete \n this task two ways. 1) Use a 100' tape measure \n and survey equipment or 2) take two bricks and a \n string line tied between the two. The distance \n between the bricks should be about 50'. Use a \n tape measure to measure the distance from the \n string to the road in high and low spots. If this dis -\n tance is greater than the required dip or swale, it \n fails. Remember to subtract or add the height of \n the brick. It is important that you complete this in -\n spection prior to any turbine component deliveries. \n If either of these are out of tolerance, the delivery \n trucks may get hung up and cause damage to \n their trucks.  \n \n      4.17. In the comment section, record any notes that \n you feel add value to this inspection.  \nFigure 4.6:Typical Road Placement Cross Section  \nFigure 4.7:Typical Road Profile Crossing Existing Crest \nArea  \nFigure 4.8:Typical Road Profile Crossing Existing Swale \nArea", "start_page": 423, "end_page": 425}

What is Lean?  \n(continued)  \n \nPerhaps the best way to understand the concept of lean thinking is to \nconsider an example from everyday life. Everyone is familiar with the dai-\nly process of brushing their teeth. The steps of the process include apply-\ning water and toothpaste to a toothbrush, rubbing the brush vigorously \nover our teeth, spitting out the wastewater, rinsing the toothbrush, etc. \nThe steps that directly contribute to the desired process output of clean \nteeth and fresh breath are those that provide value to the customer, in \nthis case yourself. The resources expended when rubbing the brush over \nyour teeth are surely value adds. But what about the time spent search-\ning for the toothpaste tube in the drawer? This provides no direct value to \nthe customer, but consumes time and energy. Perhaps you discover that \nyou are out of toothpaste and must walk down to a basement closet \nwhere you store the inventory of unopened toothpaste tubes. This is also \nwasted time and motion in the brushing process.  \n \nLean teaches us to first be aware of and identify the most common \neight types of waste present in our processes.  Lean also gives us \ntools to reduce or eliminate those wastes, thereby increasing the efficien-\ncy of our process. Lean is:  \n \n\uf0b7 A working attitude with a bias for action  \n\uf0b7 Focusing on adding value and eliminating waste  \n\uf0b7 Continuous improvement  \n \n1.2. History of Lean  \n \nFor centuries, manufacturing was a craftsman \u2019s job. Most fabricated \nitems such as furniture, musical instruments, and weaponry were hand -\nmade. This caused products to be very expensive, not replicable (each \npiece is unique), extremely variable in terms of quality, and highly de-\npendent on the craftsmen that produced the product. As a result, afforda-\nbility and mass production were unobtainable until the industrial revolu-\ntion of the 1900s.  \n \n \n\nOperations and Maintenance  \nRecommended Practices  \n\u00a9American Wind Energy Association 2017                                                                                  \n3                                      1.2. History of Lean  \n(continued)  \n \nDuring the early 1900s, the automotive industry was the most innovative \nof the era. Automobiles were manufactured all over the world; however, \nonly Henry Ford had the innovation to develop mass production tech-\nniques. Ford Motor Company \u2122 was the first company to implement the \nassembly line concept for building his classic Model T. He used various \nmethods that divided labor and used hundreds of unskilled employees to \nperform one or two repeatable tasks, such as tightening two specific \nscrews on the assembly line. Henry Ford was able to mass -produce his \nModel T Ford with high production rates at an affordable cost. This ap-\nproach, though cost effective, was laden with issues of its own: quality \nand flexibility being the biggest challenge to overcome. The famous \nquote by Henry Ford is, \u201cYou can have any color, as long as it \u2019s black \u201d. \n \nIn 1936, Toyota Group \u2122 was established. Toyota, fascinated with Ford's \nmass production assembly line, appointed an engineer to study the Hen-\nry Ford mass production operations. Japan at this time (1945) was heavi-\nly involved in World War II. Many of Japan's best and most intelligent \nmen and women were at war.  \n \nJapan was weaker than ever and had limited resources at their disposal. \nMoney for machinery, skilled labor, labor laws, and small market sizes \nwere variables Toyota needed to overcome. Toyota knew they had to de-\nvelop a company that was extremely flexible, utilize all of their limited ma-\nchinery (no downtime), only manufacture exactly what the customer or-\ndered, eliminate excess inventory, and empower every employee to own \nquality of all upstream workmanship. Toyota could not afford defects or \nquality of workmanship issues. Thus, the Toyota Production System \n(TPS) and lean were born.  \n \nIn 1950, the TPS model was proven to be very successful. Using the \nHenry Ford mass production system as a benchmark, Toyota was able to \nassemble a car in 16 hours, an improvement over the 31 hours of Henry \nFord. Toyota's biggest achievement was in quality and inventory. Toyo-\nta's employee empowerment approach reduced defects by 65% in com-\nparison to Ford and minimized inventory from Ford's 2 weeks to only 2 \nhours. Over the next 38 years, Toyota's market shares rose from around \n4% in 1950 to over 35% in 1988, surpassing Ford.", "start_page": 427, "end_page": 429}

History of Lean  \n(continued)  \n \nFrom 1980 -2000, universities and companies researched and developed \nmany variations of the TPS to meet their own educational or business \nneeds. This era is known as the \u201cLean Institute \u201d phase and focused on      \nimplementing the TPS philosophies, tools, and methods in manufacturing \nindustries. Companies quickly realized that these lean principles did not \nonly apply to manufacturing, and from the year 2000 to today the \u201cLean \nEnterprise \u201d era was established.  \n \nToday, industries such as banking, telecommunications, manufacturing, \nand energy implement lean tools and philosophies to foster continuous \nimprovement and innovation, becoming industry leaders within their busi-\nness sector.  \n \n1.3. Misconceptions about Lean Implementation  \n \nOne of the most common misconceptions and misapplications of lean is \nthinking that lean means simply getting rid of process steps, process \ntime, or process labor. Lean should never eliminate needed steps in a \nprocess. Remember that lean reduces waste and adds value. Setting  \narbitrary goals to reduce process cycle time or process costs by a certain \nrate, without understanding the value dynamics of your process, can lead \nto the elimination of truly value added steps. Instead, we need to first \ncomprehensively define what is waste and what is value so that we can \nfocus on reducing the waste in the process rather than the core of what \nwe do well, i.e. the product and process value itself.  \n \nLean may also be inappropriately described as a tool for manufacturing \nprocesses only. While it is true that lean has its roots in manufacturing, \nthe principles of lean apply to all processes and all industries. Lean    \nconcepts and tools can be applied to all stages of wind generation, from \nconstruction to operations, from reducing crew travel and transportation \nof equipment during the construction of wind turbine to ensuring that time \nspent searching for tools during turbine maintenance is reduced by \nstandardization and kitting of techniques. In addition, reducing motion  \nalso eliminates the opportunity for injuries. Implementation of a strong \nsafety culture will also promote a positive lean culture.  \n\nOperations and Maintenance  \nRecommended Practices  \n\u00a9American Wind Energy Association 2017                                                                                  \n5                                      1.4. Theory of Lean and Six Sigma  \n \nIn any process that is consistently done over time, we can utilize Six   \nSigma to understand the amount of process variation a particular process \nis experiencing. The amount of process variation from a specific target is \nknown as process variability. Identifying this variability identifies sigma \nvalues (how close are we to the target). Six Sigma is the most ideal    \nprocess capability metric. Achieving a Six Sigma level process means the \nprocess achieves the desired target 99.99999% of the time. On the other \nhand, lean focuses on the individual steps within the process and         \nensures machine reliability and efficiency over time. Thus, the two com-\nplement one another and together are \u201cLean Six Sigma \u201d. \n \nIn any process, we will find examples of the eight types of waste : \n \n\uf0b7 Transport:  movement of people, product, and information  \n\uf0b7 Inventory:  storage of spare parts, work in progress, fin-\nished goods, or supplies  \n\uf0b7 Motion:  reaching, lifting, bending, or other movements  \n\uf0b7 Waiting:  for approvals, parts, equipment, or people  \n\uf0b7 Over Production:  producing more than is needed or before \nit is needed  \n\uf0b7 Over Processing:  doing more work than is necessary, pro-\nducing tighter tolerances or grade than is necessary  \n\uf0b7 Defects:  rework, scrap, all inspection activities  \n\uf0b7 Talent:  under -utilizing people, the wrong person in the wrong \njob, lack of training or tools  \n \nAn important concept in lean thinking is that of Kaizen. Kaizen is a    \npractice of continuous improvement made by small, frequent changes for \nthe better. Traditional process improvement thinking often focuses on \nlarge step -wise improvements and trying to achieve the \u201cperfect \u201d process \nbefore implementing a change. Kaizen looks for small changes that can \nbe made every day, by everyone in the process, to ultimately drive a \nmuch larger cumulative improvement outcome.  \n \nKaizen practices can be formalized within an organization or process with \nsimple practices such as a daily improvement board or stand up improve-\nment meeting. At the beginning of each shift, team members can gather \nfor several minutes at the improvement board and each team member \nwrites down one way they will improve their work during the coming day \nor one way in which they improved the process in their last workday.", "start_page": 429, "end_page": 431}

Typical Lean Concepts  \n \nBefore we venture into specific lean concepts, it must be communicated that \nthese tools are used to solve specific business problems. For example, you \nwould never use a hammer to unscrew a nut, and lean tools are no different. \nYou would not use value stream mapping to determine the root cause of a par-\nticular failure in a gearbox. These tools are simple to use when you know where \nand when to apply them.  \n \n2.1. Value Stream Mapping: Identifying Process Gaps  \n \nValue stream mapping is a lean method used to analyze the current state \nof function in a value chain and design an optimized future state. A value \nchain is any process or series of physical events that delivers a product \nor service to a customer. Value stream mapping seeks to identify each \ntask that discretely adds value to the overall process, displaying the \nmeasured time, labor, information, and material inputs and outputs of \neach task. The value stream map is based on the concept of one -piece -\nflow, or following a single \u2018component \u2019 through a series of value added \nsteps. Knowing and documenting the current state of a process is the first \nstep in working toward an ideal future state. Understanding the concept \nof \u2018flow\u2019 is also important to the value stream concept, as it seeks to     \noptimize the efficiency of the overall process not the individual efficien-\ncies of every resource involved. This allows the user to visualize where \ndelays and waste may occur in the broader process, even when each \nsub-task may appear to be optimized.  \n \nTo create a value stream map, representatives from each functional area \nin the process should participate. The engagement of the team is key \nboth to ensuring the greatest accuracy and to facilitating conversations \nthat may not occur in the day to day working environment. Not all partici-\npants will be able to envision an optimized future state. However, they \nmay be able to identify smaller opportunities to improve flow. It \u2019s desira-\nble for the team to walk and observe first hand the physical process tak-\ning place, including measurement of inventory, cycle time, changeover \ntime (duration between locations or events), resources required (number \nof operators and equipment), utilization of resources, rework or quality \nmetrics, and available working time. Once the current state is measured \nand an optimized future state is envisioned, the gap between current and \nfuture state should be analyzed and an action plan developed to close \nthe gap. Value stream mapping has been known to identify up to 99% of \nthe non -value adding activities embedded in the current state. If done \nright, this lean method will result in tangible improvement steps that can \nbe  prioritized based on return on investment.  \n\nOperations and Maintenance  \nRecommended Practices  \n\u00a9American Wind Energy Association 2017                                                                                  \n7                                      2.2. \u201c5 Whys \u201d: Fault Analysis or Root Cause Analysis  \n \n\"5 Why\" analysis is a foundational root cause analysis method designed \nto be applied more quickly and at a higher frequency than other, more \nformal root cause analysis tools. The primary goal of the \"5 Why\" analy-\nsis is to get to root cause by repeating the question \"Why?\" five times. \nWith each consecutive iteration, the troubleshooter is brought closer to \nroot cause. In some cases, multiple root causes can be identified, and \neach one may have its own series of \"Why?\". Generally, the fifth \"Why?\" \nwill point to a process breakdown versus a physical problem. For exam-\nple, a motor failure due to lack of bearing lubrication may ultimately un-\ncover a faulty preventive maintenance program. \"5 Why\" analysis is a \nvery good introductory method to other, more sophisticated forms of \nproblem -solving.  \n \n2.3. Fishbone Diagrams: Turbine Fault Analysis or Root Cause  \nAnalysis  \n \nSimilar to \"5 Why\" analysis, fishbone diagrams seek to define and illus-\ntrate underlying causes of a defect or source of variation. Fishbone seeks \nto classify sources of variation into categories such as people, methods, \nmachines, materials, measurements, and environment. This method can \nbe useful when a team is stuck or needs to go beyond the simpler          \n\"5 Why\" approach and becomes a very good way to visualize multiple \nvariables or root causes to a problem.  \n \n2.4. Single Minute Exchange of Die (SMED): Main Component       \nExchanges and Construction  \n \nSingle Minute Exchange of Die (SMED) is a system for dramatically     \nreducing the time it takes to complete changeovers. Shigeo Shingo, a \nJapanese industrial engineer who had a record of accomplishment of \nhelping companies reduce changeover time by a documented 94%,   \nsuccessful implemented a SMED program that had benefits of reducing \ncosts, increasing safety and quality, improving responsiveness to       \ncustomer demand, reducing inventory levels, and allowing for improved \nstartups.  \n \nWhile it may not be possible to reduce all changeovers to one minute, \nthis process takes the approach that any downtime or non -value added \ntime is eliminated. Like most lean tools, SMED is in other industries out - \nside of just manufacturing. NASCAR \u2122 pit crews, for example, employ \nSMED to further study and reduce the times of their pit stops. Because \nSMED is a relatively resource intensive process, sound judgement is \nnecessary in order to determine where it can be best applied.", "start_page": 431, "end_page": 433}

Single Minute Exchange of Die (SMED): Main Component        \nExchanges and Construction  \n(continued)  \n \nIt may be the case, for example, that there are other areas that should be \naddressed first before changeovers. If mechanical reliability is a greater \nloss point than changeovers, it may make more sense to focus on imple-\nmenting a reliability centered maintenance program before reducing \nchangeovers. In this scenario, changeovers may have additional variabil-\nity due to mechanical issues that arise and need to be corrected in that \ndowntime.  \n \n2.5. Overall Equipment Effectiveness (OEE): Hourly or Energy Based \nAvailability  \n \nOverall equipment effectiveness (OEE) is a standard for measuring man-\nufacturing productivity. The concept was developed in the 1960s to evalu-\nate how effectively a manufacturing operation is utilized. Because results \nare expressed as a percentage of standard, OEE can be compared     \nbetween different operations or industries. To achieve a score of 100% \nOEE, a system must run at 100% quality: zero defects, 100% perfor-\nmance, and as fast as system design speed allows. It must also run at \n100% availability: no stop time. By measuring OEE and the underlying \nlosses, productivity can be systematically improved. Variances from \nstandard can be graphed in a Pareto diagram, and improvement plans \ncan be made to address the highest impact losses from system perfor-\nmance. Because OEE takes into account all loses, it can be considered a \nholistic measure of performance.  \n \n2.6. 5S (Sort, Set, Shine, Standardize, Sustain): Inventory and Tool \nManagement  \n \n5S is a process to reduce waste, improve safety, and optimize productivi-\nty through maintaining an orderly workplace and using visual cues to \nachieve more consistent operational results. 5S addresses many of the \neight wastes of production, and many organizations use 5S to set a foun-\ndation for developing a continuous improvement culture. 5S is equally ap-\nplicable and effective in all sectors.  \n \nThe process was developed in manufacturing and was popularized by \nToyota. The term 5S references the first letter of the Japanese words for \neach step in the process. English translations are not exact but typically \nmaintain the nomenclature. 5S requires the user of a workspace to be \ndirectly involved in the organization and sustainability of the process. \nConsistent utilization of this method can lead to a greatly increased sense \nof ownership for equipment, with gains in safety, quality, morale, and \nproductivity.  \n\nOperations and Maintenance  \nRecommended Practices  \n\u00a9American Wind Energy Association 2017                                                                                  \n9                                      3. Applying Lean Concepts in Wind Site Management Operations  \n \n3.1. Organizational Alignment and Commitment to Continuous      \nImprovement  \n \nAs companies implement continuous improvement to streamline process-\nes and reduce costs, too often lean tools are deployed as the objectives \nrather than as specific project goals. Unfortunately, training for these \ntools is typically done in a shotgun approach, delivering an unintentional \nmessage that short -term results are the desired endgame. These project \ninitiatives may result in respectable cost savings, but on their own will \nnever release the full potential of people in an organization unless        \nreviewed and aligned with corporate goals. So before anyone trains and \nassigns champions to implement 5S principles, standardize a service, or \noptimize warehouse inventory, a more fundamental focus on team culture \nand organizational alignment needs to be framed at all levels.  \n \nSince \u201cyou cannot improve what you can \u2019t measure, \u201d a lean program will \ntypically start with an event defining the organizations key metrics, includ-\ning how they will drive department, team, and finally individual day -to- \nday measures. Every company has a mission statement or a set of goals \nbased on visions and values that coalesce into a written declaration of its \ncore purpose of existence. The first stage in developing a continuous   \nimprovement culture is for everyone to understand the organizational \nmeasures and how they will affect the strategic goals.  \n \nMost organizational measures can be organized into one of Kaplan and \nNorton's four categories of a balanced scorecard: customer, financial, \nprocess, and learning and growth[1]. In addition, manufacturing and heavy \nindustry typically use safety as a fifth category. With long -term and annu-\nal strategic goals for reference, each department and team should brain-\nstorm key measures that align their daily activities with the corporate \ngoals.  \n \nWhen developing these measures, no more than one or two per category \nare necessary. Using a benchmark, like the 31 seconds visual manage-\nment rule, basic dashboard metrics would provide anyone a three second \nprocess overview, a 10 second display of trends, and in 20 seconds iden-\ntify the solutions and proposed improvements currently being pursued. \nThen, by creating tiered metrics, an organization can use dashboards to \ndrive daily team huddles (stand up or green area meetings), further align-\ning management and supporting departments with field operations in vi-\nsion and direction. This not only helps provide clear instructions and \ngoals for individual accountability, but also enables better information \nsharing and planning to address critical issues as they develop. These \nare all important first steps in developing and maintaining a continuous \nimprovement culture.", "start_page": 433, "end_page": 435}

Cultural Onsite Enablers  \n \nA company culture is generally defined as the collective way in which  \nemployees interact to make the day -to-day, large and small, decisions \nthat execute the organization's vision and strategy. Even with all of their \nstrengths, lean tools arguably only contribute 20% to a successful contin-\nuous improvement program. However, if an organization has a strong \nlean culture, it will contribute the other 80% . Hence, once the foundation-\nal strategy is clear to everyone and measurement goals are established, \nadditional cultural enablers can be developed into a framework that    \npromotes a philosophy of seeking perfection in all work processes.  \n \nClear goals and metrics, along with daily communication, are clearly    \nimportant in a lean culture as described. Still, much of a cultural founda-\ntion lies in linking common HR behavior expectations to lean implementa-\ntion rules and standards. The processes of recruitment, formal orienta-\ntion, training, individual development, and reward systems all play a large \npart in giving employees the basic skills and instincts to contribute to \ncompany improvements. And once these links have been shaped, the \nfocus must be redirected to leadership, which needs to gain the respect \nof new employees through both coaching and mentoring performance \nobjectives.  \n \nOrganizational alignment and culture building are not complicated, but \nthe processes are broad in scope. Development of a lean culture needs \nto cascade through an organization and be introduced from the moment \na potential candidate is interviewed, through orientation and on -the-job \ntraining, and continue well into a person \u2019s career with the company. This \nenables leadership to demonstrate humility by constantly engaging em-\nployees and providing them with personal learning and development op-\nportunities for growth.  \n \n3.3. Common Mistakes and Lessons Learned  \n \nThere is plenty of opportunity to learn from poorly implemented lean   \nprograms. The internet is littered with case studies and war stories of   \nimprovement projects gone wrong. For wind energy, the top ten common \nmistakes can be summed -up as follows:  \n \n \n\nOperations and Maintenance  \nRecommended Practices  \n\u00a9American Wind Energy Association 2017                                                                                  \n11                                      3.3. Common Mistakes and Lessons Learned  \n(continued)  \n \n3.3.1. Starting a lean transformation without experienced and pro-\nfessional help  \n \nIt is very difficult to complete a lean event if there is lack of training \nor involvement in continuous improvement work. Whether the \nteam draws on an internal lean facilitator or contracts an external \nexpert, it is always best to employ someone with Kaizen experi-\nence to work with teams during the start of any project or major \nprogram.  \n \n3.3.2. Relying completely on a lean champion  \n \nOn the other hand, a strong and committed implementation team \nis necessary for any project to be successful. External experts  \ntypically do not have the authority or commitment to make things \nhappen that are necessary to fully optimize a process.  \n \n3.3.3. Too many conflicting metrics  \n \nThe KISS (Keep It Simple Stupid) principle needs to be closely  \nfollowed in regards to dashboards. One measurement per catego-\nry is ideal, but never have more than two. While there may be doz-\nens of key performance indicators (KPI) being tracked by various \nteams or departments for each category, only the primary metrics \nshould be displayed for daily huddle meetings.  \n \n3.3.4. Continuous improvement not linked to a business plan  \n \nThis mistake is easily rectified through communication. Before any \nactions are initiated, each group or individual needs to submit a \nbrief plan or project charter. The proposal must be quickly          \nreviewed, compared to the annual plan and/or other projects in \nqueue, and approved by a designated leader or cross functional \nteam. This is to avoid one of the worst \u201cwastes \u201d: doing work that \ndoes not need to be done at all.  \n \n3.3.5. Not providing adequate training, facilitation, and follow -up \n \nA few hours or days of training will not create an expert. Continu-\nous improvement teams need to be developed using a combina-\ntion of classroom training, project work, and benchmarking. And \neven when a skilled group is available, a facilitator needs to be \nidentified or trained to direct and focus team progress.", "start_page": 435, "end_page": 437}

Believing a tool, such as 5S implementation, can be com-\npleted in a day or even week  \n \nOne can seldom complete the \"Set in Order\" step of a 5S project \nin a week. Two or three rounds of review are normally required to \nbe sure excess material, tools and equipment are properly disposi-\ntioned. A process checklist with defined steps is the best way to \nensure sustainability and accountability.  \n \n3.3.7. Treating symptoms and not determining root cause  \n \nUnfortunately, some problems get fixed only to reoccur. Lean tools \nsuch as the \u201c5 Why\u201d analysis are specifically designed to guide a \nteam to define the root cause. While these methods take more \ntime and discipline, solving a reoccurring problem normally saves \na lot of time and cost.  \n \n3.3.8. Believing you will achieve a lean transformation only by         \napplying lean tools  \n \nWhile all of the lean tools can help solve problems and reduce \ncosts, creating a lean culture is the endgame.  \n \n3.3.9. Lack of top management understanding and commitment  \n \nNo program will ever survive leadership apathy. Lean needs to be \nunderstood and promoted by top management. Employees are \ninspired to improve by leadership \u201cwalking the talk \u201d and expecting \nto see management embracing change and pursuing perfection.  \n \n3.3.10. Making the statement and believing \u201cwe have completed a \nlean program \u201d \n \nIt is called \u201ccontinuous improvement \u201d because the journey is never \ncomplete. When you stop improving, there is always another entity \nwilling to further innovate and claim your business market share.  \n \n \n\nOperations and Maintenance  \nRecommended Practices  \n\u00a9American Wind Energy Association 2017                                                                                  \n13                                      4. Lean and Site Management Principles  \n \nMany people ask about the difference between quality ISO standards and lean \nimplementation. The best way to communicate the difference is to recognize \nthat there is not a difference. Quality by itself is an overarching umbrella that \nuses various methods to improve standards and improve operations. Lean is \nthe agent that bonds us to our ISO requirements and maximizes the value of \nour product to our customers. Top organizations may be ISO compliant, with \nrigorous quality manuals and procedures, but lack innovation, culture, and con-\ntinuous improvement.  \n \nLean innovation takes a good quality program to the next level of operational \nexcellence. In order to achieve this level of operational excellence, a company \nmust have the basic quality programs in place. The quality program will provide \nan essential foundation and further establish a corporate culture of structure \nand continuous improvement. Companies that view the certification as the end \nobjective (check the box) will not be as successful as companies that implement \na lean program to accompany their quality program. A lean program will further \nenhance a company \u2019s quality program and improve the day -to-day operations. \nReducing safety incidents, improving product reliability, and improving customer \nsatisfaction takes continuous improvement. The lean tools will only help facili-\ntate these improvements.  \n \n4.1. Metric Development and KPI Management  \n \n4.1.1. Key performance indicators (KPI) are set by management.  \n \n\uf0b7 Goals and objectives are identified through manage-\nment and customer expectations.  \n\uf0b7 Quality expectations, or customer requirements, are \ntranslated by management.  \n \n4.1.2. Metrics are reflective of control point data.  \n \nMetrics are the data points that reflect process or product perfor-\nmance.

Accountability and Ownership  \n \n4.2.1 Quality Plans: Proactive versus Reactive  \n \nQuality planning should be performed in conjunction with other \nplanning processes. To plan for quality, the team identifies the \nquality requirements and standards for the deliverables and docu-\nments how the project will demonstrate compliance.  \n \nThe items to review to assist in the identification of quality require-\nments include, but are not limited to, the following:  \n \n\uf0b7 Project charter or scope statement describing the deliv-\nerables and acceptance criteria  \n\uf0b7 Work breakdown structure (WBS) identifying each deliv-\nerable  \n\uf0b7 Cost or budget outlining constraints to providing the de-\nliverables  \n\uf0b7 Schedule highlighting the timeframe to deliver the pro-\nject \n\uf0b7 Risk register identifying information and threats to suc-\ncessful project completion  \n\uf0b7 Outside factors, including regulations or operating condi-\ntions, impacting the project  \n\uf0b7 Organizational process assets, including quality policies, \nsupplier management programs, and lessons learned, \nassisting the project  \n \nAs part of identifying the quality requirements, the team is to be \naware of the benefits of meeting quality requirements, including \nless rework, higher productivity, lower costs, and increased stake-\nholder satisfaction. The tradeoff to delivering a quality project is \nthe \u201ccost of quality \u201d, including the costs incurred in preventing non -\nconformance to requirements, inspecting the deliverables for con-\nformance, and reworking a deliverable to meet requirements.  \n \n4.2.2. Quality Assurance (QA) and Quality Control (QC)  \n \nQA can be defined as a set of activities designed to ensure that \nprocesses are established ensuring the project deliverables com-\nply with relevant quality standards throughout the project lifecycle, \nincluding project audits and process checklists.

Quality Assurance (QA) and Quality Control (QC)  \n(continued)  \n \nTypically, QA activities are performed during project planning and \nexecution. QA is closely related to QC in that QA processes utilize \nmeasurements obtained during QC to adjust or improve process-\nes, ensuring non -conformances are prevented. QA activities may \nbe conducted during the specific project being worked or may be \npart of an overall company or business unit initiative for continuous \nimprovement.  \n \nQA activities can involve, but are not limited to, the following:  \n \n\uf0b7 Reviewing performance measures (How is the project \nperforming compared to plan?). Ongoing issues may \nindicate non -conformance.  \n\uf0b7 Examining project deliverable status (Are the delivera-\nbles acceptable?). Rushed deliverables increase non -\nconformance.  \n\uf0b7 Determining schedule progress (What is the schedule \nstatus versus plan?). Nonconforming deliverables may \nbe causing rework.  \n\uf0b7 Evaluating project costs incurred (What is the current \nactual project cost versus plan?). Nonconforming deliv-\nerables incur cost to correct.  \n \nTypically, QA activities are performed as part of a self -assessment \nor audit process and should complement a lessons learned pro-\ncess that includes identifying best practices, opportunity areas, \nperformance gaps, sharing information, and proactively offering \nassistance in a positive manner to improve.  \n \nThe results of QA activities can include change requests to either \nrework specific deliverables or to modify deliverables to meet the \nquality requirements.

QC activities are per-\nformed throughout the project and involve the measurement of \n\u2018planned \u2019 versus \u2018actual \u2019 results.  \n \nThe planned results, or acceptance criteria, are defined during the    \nplanning phase of a project. As the deliverables are produced, \nthey are measured with actual results. As long as the actual re-\nsults are within the tolerance range, or acceptable variance, then \nthe deliverable is in conformance. If the actual results are outside \nthe tolerance limits planned, then the deliverable is in non -\nconformance and follows a disposition process. The disposition \nprocess determines if the deliverable requires reworking, scrap-\nping, or accepting through a change request process.  \n \nQC activities can involve, but are not limited to, the following:  \n \n\uf0b7 Inspection of project design, both internally and exter-\nnally created  \n\uf0b7 Details drawing completeness and accuracy  \n\uf0b7 Designing input/output (I/O) points  \n\uf0b7 Bill of material (BOM) completeness and accuracy  \n\uf0b7 Vendor surveillance or inspection program  \n\uf0b7 Establishing inspection hold points for critical material  \n\uf0b7 Ensuring vendor is producing material within design lim-\nits \n\uf0b7 Inspection of received materials against the design or \norder upon receipt  \n\uf0b7 Identifying that the correct part numbers, quantities, and \nitems are delivered  \n\uf0b7 Implementing a disposition process for non -conforming        \nmaterials  \n \n4.2.2.1. Inspection and Test Plans (ITP) for Identified \nActivities  \n \nITPs are activity roadmaps with the procedures, skills, and \ntools needed to perform the sequential tasks, with control \npoints for the inspections and data identification.  \n \n \n\nOperations and Maintenance  \nRecommended Practices  \n\u00a9American Wind Energy Association 2017                                                                                  \n17                                      4.2.2.2.

Resources may include workforce, equip-\nment, documentation, software, hardware, and logistical \nneeds.  \n \n4.3. Sustaining Results and Continuous Improvement  \n \n4.3.1. Monitor, Control, and Improve  \n \nMonitor and control involves review of the QA and QC activities to \nensure the deliverables are produced meeting the quality require-\nments. Controlling project quality helps ensure non -conformances \nare identified prior to project close. The benefits of meeting the \nproject quality requirements are to be reviewed against the cost of \nquality from following the value added processes to meet or at-\ntempt to meet the quality requirements.  \n \nTools and techniques utilized to monitor the project quality include, \nbut are not limited to:  \n \n\uf0b7 Identification of deliverable non -conformance  \n\uf0b7 Control points  \n\uf0b7 Variance analysis  \n\uf0b7 ITPs with control points  \n\uf0b7 Project self -assessments  \n\uf0b7 Project audits  \n\uf0b7 Change management processes and associated change \nlogs \n\uf0b7 Performance reports  \n\uf0b7 Internal audits or daily walk downs  \n \nReview deliverable quality requirements on a defined periodic ba-\nsis to ensure they are being met or the correct preventative actions \nare established.

Warehouse and Tool Management  \n \n5.1. Warehouse Optimization  \n \nIn the 1980s, the Toyota Production System was introduced in North \nAmerican manufacturing as \u201cJust-In-Time \u201d (JIT) inventory control. Basi-\ncally, the concept was that inventory is an insurance policy. As equip-\nment, processes, and operator skill levels improved throughout an opera-\ntion, the raw materials, component parts, works -in-process, and finished \ngoods inventory throughout the manufacturing process dramatically de - \ncreased. In the automotive industry, this meant millions of dollars of capi-\ntal were freed up with a successful JIT program. Optimizing space utiliza-\ntion, material flow, order picking, and dock operations create significant \ncost savings in material and labor.  \n \nAt the site level in the wind industry, most warehouse facilities are very \nsmall in comparison to the manufacturing industry. An efficient use of \nspace is always desired in construction and service operations to control \ncost. Whether the building is new or an existing property, the first step in \nimproving material and work flow is to use the value stream mapping tool. \nWind farm warehouse layouts are fairly standard in design, consisting of \npallet racking, small parts shelving, oil storage, oil containment, and ship-\nping/receiving areas. With limited floor space, the goal is often simply to \nuse all horizontal and vertical space as effectively as possible, reducing \ntime to pick and stage parts that could otherwise be spent more produc-\ntively. For example, oil management can be optimized by setting up a \nrack with the different oils, coolants, and cleaners in bulk storage tanks. \nThe tanks can be easily filled by pumps and dispensed by hoses con-\nnected to a valve header.  \n \n5.2. Metrics and Accountability  \n \nThe standard measures for monitoring the health of a warehouse are in-\nventory accuracy and total cost. Measurement of inventory turns can also \nbe applied. However, many stock decisions are based on component \nlead-times, and inventory turns often are dictated by the make, model, \nand age of the equipment. Inventory levels can balloon or become inac-\ncurate very quickly if not kept in check. Non -inventory items, especially, \ntend to grow exponentially if not tracked by piece or part count. Most non -\ninventory items are written off and have no assigned cost, which makes \ninformation difficult to share with other sites. A good practice is to estab-\nlish a \u201cblacklist \u201d of non -inventory parts that can be shared, especially af-\nter initial construction, otherwise the items end up lost or damaged in the \nyard or warehouse without a chance of recovering value, except, inevita-\nbly, as scrap.", "start_page": 443, "end_page": 445}

Metrics and Accountability  \n(continued)  \n \nEvery warehouse needs a trained associate to maintain the stock and to \nmaintain the integrity of the material requirements planning (MRP) sys-\ntem that tracks inventory levels and re -order points. While great effort is \ntypically paid to training technicians, formal inventory control training is \nusually non -existent, consisting of basic MRP software data entry with no \nwarehouse or logistic training. With wind farm sizes varying dramatically, \nit is often not viable to have a dedicated inventory coordinator onsite. In \neither case, an employee with the aptitude and organizational skill needs \nto be identified and made accountable. Bar coding can be used to enter \nand relieve stock, for example. And with many scanning systems, the \nparts can be scanned and assigned directly to a work order. Ultimately, \nthere needs to be one local associate assigned to guarantee the integrity \nof the part levels through daily or weekly cycle counting. A great resource \nto help setup inventory and logistic training is the American Production \nand Inventory Control Society, or APICS \u2122. Their website offers learning \nresources and an industry certification to use as a benchmark.  \n \n6. Technician Continuous Improvement  \n \nIn order to create a quality culture, it is important to ensure that technicians re-\nceive skills and knowledge regarding the use of data driven problem -solving. \nThis could be analysis for special cause variation or the use of Six Sigma tools \nfor common cause variation. In an ideal state, promotions to more advanced \nwind technician levels include the requirement to have the data driven problem -\nsolving skill set in place. This includes both the academic and real world appli-\ncation of quality tools.  \n \nA format used for special cause variation analysis is the \u201cQuality Improvement \nStory \u201d. This is a seven step problem -solving process in which the team uses da-\nta to identify a project indicator and sets a target for improvement. A tie to the \ncustomer focus and company strategy is established, ensuring focus remains on \nthe primary key objectives as defined by the customer. Project teams gather ad-\nditional information, using tools like Pareto graphs, to further scope the problem. \nThen, they use an additional tool for analysis, such as the fishbone diagram, to \nbrainstorm potential causes. The potential causes are verified through testing. \nThe testing performed must identify the true root cause of the problem and any \ncontributing factors.  \n\nOperations and Maintenance  \nRecommended Practices  \n\u00a9American Wind Energy Association 2017                                                                                  \n21                                      6. Technician Continuous Improvement  \n(continued)  \n \nCountermeasures used to reduce or eliminate the root cause are identified \nthrough the use of a countermeasure matrix, which helps the user identify      \npotential corrective actions, costs, and risks of implementation. Results are \nproven through plotting the post -countermeasure project indicator data and \ncomparing against the initial target. The team then works to ensure that counter-\nmeasures are replicated across the site and across the applicable turbine tech-\nnology in the standardization step. Remaining actions and the next project are \nidentified in the future plans step.  \n \nCommon cause variation is addressed through Six Sigma's \u201cDefine Measure  \nAnalyze Improve and Control \u201d (DMAIC) methodology and is recommended for \nthe wind operations management ranks. The technicians may be called in to \nparticipate in a measurement systems analysis or process mapping exercise.  \n \n6.1.

Lean Workshops and Frequent Kaizen Events  \n \nThe company will provide opportunities for technicians to provide      \nfeedback on lean workshops and schedule Kaizen events. These types of \nactivities are scheduled based upon the needs and priorities of the organ-\nization. \n \nA technician would not be expected to lead the event; however, they \nmust be part of a team for the duration, which lasts three to five days, in \norder to provide their field experience and technical knowledge of the \nproblem. The event normally requires process mapping. The technician \nworks with the team to identify areas of the process in which there is    \nopportunity for improvement. The technician would help to identify value \nadd, business value add, and non -value add activities. A technician may \neven be called in for a short duration in order to provide feedback on the \nactivities of the team or to offer their knowledge for the problem at hand. \nAn example would be to help identify which types of waste exist in the \nprocess, including transportation, inventory, motion, talent, waiting, over-\nproduction, over -processing, or defects.  \n \nParticipation in these events can present the technician with opportunities \nto work on an individual \u201cQuality Improvement Story \u201d.
